      <ion-text>
        <ul>
        <li>1 g of carbohydrates contains 4 kcal</li>
        <li>1 g of protein contains 4 kcal</li>

        <h1 class="green">Example:-</h1>
          <br/>

      </ion-text>

      <ion-text>
        <ul>       
        <li>Fat: 23.11 g<br/>

        23.11 g x 9 kcal = 207.99 kcal</li>

        <li>Protein: 30.52 g  <br/>

        30.52 x 4 kcal = 122.08 kcal</li>

        <li>Carbohydrate: 1.75 g<br/>

        1.75 x 4 kcal = 7 kcal</li>

        others are metabolized by gut bacteria, while other types pass through the body.<br/><br/>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiber and unprocessed starch are complex carbs. It takes the body some time to break down and 
        absorb complex carbs. After eating fiber, a person will feel full for longer. Fiber may also 
        reduce the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and colorectal cancer.
        Complex carbs are a more healthful choice than sugars and refined carbs.
